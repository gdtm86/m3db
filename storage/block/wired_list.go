// The wired list is the primary data structure that is used to support the LRU
// caching policy. It is a global (per-database) structure that is shared
// between all namespaces, shards, and series. It is responsible for determining
// which blocks should be kept "wired" (cached) in memory, and which should be
// closed and fetched again from disk if they need to be retrieved in the future.
//
// The WiredList is basically a specialized LRU, except that it doesn't store the
// data itself, it just keeps track of which data is currently in memory and makes
// decisions about which data to remove from memory. Updating the Wired List is
// asynchronous: callers put an operation to modify the list into a channel and
// a background goroutine pulls from that channels and performs updates to the
// list which may include removing items from memory ("unwiring" blocks).
//
// The WiredList itself does not allocate a per-entry datastructure to keep track
// of what is active and what is not. Instead, it creates a "virtual list" ontop
// of the existing blocks that are in memory by manipulating struct-level pointers
// on the DatabaseBlocks which are "owned" by the list. In other words, the
// DatabaseBlocks are scattered among numerous namespaces/shards/series, but they
// existed in virtual sorted order via the prev/next pointers they contain, but
// which are only manipulated by the WiredList.
//
// The WiredList ONLY keeps track of blocks that are read from disk. Blocks that
// are created by rotating recently-written data out of buffers and into new
// DatabaseBlocks are managed by the background ticks of the series. The background
// tick will avoid closing blocks that were read from disk, and a block will never
// be provided to the WiredList if it wasn't read from disk. This prevents tricky
// ownership semantics where both the background tick and and the WiredList are
// competing for ownership / trying to close the same blocks.
